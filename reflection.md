- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

For the cafe class, I felt that the constructor took in a lot of parameters, so I overloaded the constructor twice so that for example, an aspiring entrepreneur could construct their cafe in stages. Sometimes all they have is a building without deciding a name or any stock, or perhaps they figured out a name but haven't purchased any stock. 

I did the same for the library and house classes because I felt like the other methods didn't really have other options for parameters. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
