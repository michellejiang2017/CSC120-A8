- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

For the cafe class, I felt that the constructor took in a lot of parameters, so I overloaded the constructor twice so that for example, an aspiring entrepreneur could construct their cafe in stages. Sometimes all they have is a building without deciding a name or any stock, or perhaps they figured out a name but haven't purchased any stock. 

I did the same for the library and house classes because I felt like the other methods didn't really have other options for parameters. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I like that the readme has basically all the instructions of what to do and like I didn't really need to google anything because we were taught pretty much everything in class and I could just follow the instructions step by step. What didn't work was me kind of wanting to get this assignment done with and trying to finish it asap which made me kind of simplify some steps which then led to me needing to go back and fix those steps. I would give the advice: go to class, pay attention, don't skip any steps.
